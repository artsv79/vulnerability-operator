## Overview

TODO


## Kubernetes Compatibility

The image contains versions of `k8s.io/client-go`. Kubernetes aims to provide forwards & backwards compatibility of one minor version between client and server:

| vulnerability-operator   | k8s.io/{api,apimachinery,client-go} | expected kubernetes compatibility |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| main                     | v0.23.3                             | 1.22.x, 1.23.x, 1.24.x            |


However, the operator will work with more versions of Kubernetes in general.


## Installation

#### Manifests

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/
```

#### Helm-Chart

Create a YAML file first with the required configurations or use helm-flags instead.

```
helm repo add ckotzbauer https://ckotzbauer.github.io/helm-charts
helm install ckotzbauer/vulnerability-operator -f your-values.yaml
```


## Security

The docker-image is based on `scratch` to reduce the attack-surface and keep the image small. Furthermore the image and release-artifacts are signed 
with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) and attested with provenance-files. The release-process satisfies SLSA Level 2. All of those "metadata files" are 
also stored in a dedicated repository `ghcr.io/ckotzbauer/vulnerability-operator-metadata`.
Both, SLSA and the signatures are still experimental for this project.
